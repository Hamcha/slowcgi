# Description #
This is like fcgiwrap but unsupported and wrote in 10 minutes.

# Reason #
I'm bored and configuring fcgiwrap was being more burdening than writing my own thing.

# Building #
"go build"
Included is an nginx location example so you don't have to ask on StackOverflow.

# Command line info #
"slowcgi -h"

# Extra #
It can run as its own HTTP server if you want to use proxy_pass instead of fcgi, but I haven't tested it.
